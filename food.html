        <p>But before diving into the delicious world of South Korean cuisine, it’s important to understand the dining etiquette that accompanies it. Korean meals are not just about the food — they’re about respect, harmony, and shared experience. Learning these customs helps you appreciate the food even more, allowing you to enjoy each dish the way it’s meant to be — with mindfulness and respect.</p>
        <p>In Korea, dining manners are taken seriously.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You should wait for the eldest to start eating before you do</li>
            <li>never lift your bowl while eating</li>
            <li>avoid sticking chopsticks upright in rice (it resembles funeral rituals)</li>
            <li>It’s also polite to pour drinks for others rather than yourself.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Meals are usually shared. A group eats from the same set of dishes rather than having individual portions. This reflects the importance of harmony and togetherness in Korean culture.</p>
        <p>Side Dishes (Banchan) are small plates served with rice, usually including kimchi, pickled vegetables, seasoned greens, fish cakes, or pancakes. Banchan is unlimited in many restaurants and represents balance and variety in Korean meals.</p>
